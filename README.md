This project analyzes a suspicious email that impersonates a bank to trick users into clicking a fake link.  
Key phishing indicators like spoofed sender address, urgent language, and misleading URL were identified.  
The domain was verified using WHOIS and found to be unrelated to the real bank.  
Tools used: grep, whois, and manual analysis.  
Screenshots and evidence are included.  
The goal was to understand how phishing emails work and how to detect them.  
Part of a cybersecurity internship task.
